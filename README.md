# README

This is a second experiment in using Ruby on Rails, based on the depot example
in "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Ruby and Thomas, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2023.

The tags in the commits show where the tutorial ends and my own experiments were added
in branches, based on the "Playtime" sections of the chapters from the book.
