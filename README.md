# README

This is a second experiment in using Ruby on Rails. It is based on the depot example in "Agile Web Development with Rails 7" by Ruby and Thomas, The Pragmatic Bookshelf, 2023.

The tags in the commits show where the tutorial ends and my own experiments were added in branches, based on the "Playtime" sections of the chapters from the book.

Having completed the first six sections of this extended tutorial, including coding most of the playtime extensions myself, it appears the example has covered many of the key concepts of Rails, in a broadly demonstrative manner.

This gives me confidence in acquiring an overview of Rails. Next I plan to do smaller but more focused work, looking at aspects of Rails in detail this time, in readiness for a build of my own, from scratch.
